# Description of Problem: 
To implement a Minimum Risk Bayes Decision Theoretic classifier and use it to classify the test examples in the provided datasets(iris_dataset.dat) and (corrupted_iris_dataset.dat)

# Description of your Solution: 
irisdata_Bayes_Decision_Classifier.m is primary program which reads file iris_dataset.dat. This program shuffles data divides data into training data (90% of original data) and test data (10% of original data) in each iteration (total 10 iterations). Based on discriminative functions it classifies test data. Accuracy during each iteration is displayed. At the end of program average accuracy is also depicted. Output of it is displayed in irisdata_Output_ScreenShot.png.

CorruptedData.m_Bayes_Decision_Classifier.m is secondary program which reads file corrupted_iris_dataset.dat. This program shuffles data divides data into training data (90% of original data) and test data (10% of original data) in each iteration (total 10 iterations). Based on discriminative functions it classifies test data. Accuracy during each iteration is displayed. At the end of program average accuracy is also depicted. Output of it is displayed in Corrupteddata _Output_ScreenShot.png.
