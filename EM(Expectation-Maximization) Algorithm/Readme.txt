# Description of Problem:
To implement the EM(Expectation-Maximization) algorithm. 
• Column 1: sepal length
• Column 2: sepal width
• 50 samples for setosa, 50 samples for versicolor
performs the test examples in the provided datasets(simple_iris_dataset.dat) 

# Description of your Solution: 
In this folder EM_irisdata.m is primary project which reads file  from simple_iris_dataset.dat. This project implements EM(Expectation-Maximization) algorithm. This program has one output graph. The screen shot (EMAlgo_Output_screenshot.png) of this output graph is is in the folder.
