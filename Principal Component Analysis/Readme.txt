Description of Problem:
To demonstrate Principal Component Analysis based dimensionality reduction by using Minimum Risk Bayes Decision Theoretic classifier by classifyig the test examples in the provided datasets(iris_dataset.dat) 

Description of your Solution: 
Principal_Component_Analysis.m is a program which reads file iris_dataset.dat. This program shuffles data divides data into training data (90% of original data) and test data (10% of original data) in each iteration (total 10 iterations). Based on discriminative functions it classifies test data. Accuracy during each iteration is displayed. At the end of program average accuracy is also depicted. By Compare the accuracy between Bayes Classification on the dataset directly and the dimensionality reduced dataset using 10 fold cross validation.Output of it is displayed in Step1_output_screenshot.png
